                    Researchers may have access to anonymized experimental research
                    records. However, because of the nature of electronic
                    systems, it is possible that respondents could be
                    identified by some electronic record associated with the
                    response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with
                    this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
                    publications based on this research will use only group
                    data and will not identify you or any individual as being
                    affiliated with this project.
