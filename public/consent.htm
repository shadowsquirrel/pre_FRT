                        project is voluntary.

                    You do not have to
                    participate. Even if you begin the web-based experiment, you
                    can stop at any time by closing your browser.

                    We anticipate that
                    it will take about

                    to complete this
                    task. However, you will only be rewarded for completing
                    the task, not for the length of time you participate.

                <p>
                    You will be compensated in good faith for participating in this
                    experiment.
                    Submissions will be <strong>rejected</strong>
                    if they are completed in a manner that appears to be random,
                    incomplete, or otherwise negligent
                    (e.g. failing to answer specific questions correctly).

                        Your part in this study is anonymized to the

                    </strong>
                    Researchers may have access to anonymized experimental research
                    records. However, because of the nature of electronic
                    systems, it is possible that respondents could be
                    identified by some electronic record associated with the
                    response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with
                    this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
                    publications based on this research will use only group
                    data and will not identify you or any individual as being
                    affiliated with this project.

                        Confidentiality of Data
                    </strong>
                    Your data will be stored securely and pseudonymously
                    (without your name or identity attached to the data),
                    and only the Study Coordinator will be able to relate
                    the data to the identity of the subject.
                    The data will be stored using the standard best practices
                    for maintaining data security.
                    Access to data will be granted subject to the conditions
                    stated herein. In accordance with Max-Planck-Society rules
                    your personal data will be saved at the institute for at
                    least 5 years. If you should decide to withdraw your consent,
                    then your data will be blocked and not used from the point
                    of withdrawal. Any data used before consent withdrawal will
                    remain in use.
